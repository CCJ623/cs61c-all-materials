Checkoff Question 1: Because Step Size in byte is equal to Block Size in bytes, no matter how many times it repeats.
Checkoff Question 2: Array Size, Step Size
Checkoff Question 3: First M because the cache is cold. Second H is a write to the set we've just read in. Third and Forth H is read and write the 3rd way in the same set.
Checkoff Question 4: Becase Block Size is equal to Array Size, after a full inner loop, the whole array will be fill in the cache, the access after that always hit.
Checkoff Question 5: We could access a Block Size of the array at a time, apply all function to every elements sits in this area, then we move on in a Step Size which is equal to Block Size.
Checkoff Question 6: Cache Size of level 2 is equal to Array Size in bytes, we alwasy hit level 2 cache after one inner loop.
